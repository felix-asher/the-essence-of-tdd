# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this repository.  
If you are unsure whether something belongs as a contribution,
starting a discussion is always the right first step.

This project is not a software product, a framework, or a methodology.
It is a written exploration of how test-driven development functions
as a process of design discovery.

As such, contributions are intentionally limited.

## What This Repository Is

- A single, opinionated document
- A record of observations, not prescriptions
- A text meant to be read, discussed, and challenged

The primary goal is clarity of thought, not feature growth.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

### Discussion and Critique

- Thoughtful questions
- Disagreement with reasoning (not tone)
- Alternative interpretations, posted as discussions
- Counterexamples from real projects

If something feels wrong, unclear, or incomplete, say so.
Discussion is the preferred channel.

### Minor Corrections

- Typos
- Grammatical fixes
- Broken links
- Formatting issues

These can be submitted as pull requests.

## What Contributions Are Not Accepted

- Rewrites or expansions of the main document
- Alternative versions or forks presented as improvements
- New sections proposing a different framework or process
- Metric systems, checklists, or step-by-step recipes

This is not a collaborative specification.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are reviewed conservatively.

A PR may be closed even if it is technically correct,
if it changes the tone, intent, or scope of the document.

This is by design.

## Translations

Translations are not accepted via pull request.

If you are interested in translating this document,
please open a discussion first.  
The goal is to preserve intent and tone, not to localize concepts aggressively.

## Forking

Forks are allowed under the license,
but please avoid presenting modified versions
as the original text.

## Final Note

If you are looking to *add* something,
a discussion is almost always the right place to start.

If you are looking to *replace* something,
this repository is probably not the right venue.

Thanks for reading.
