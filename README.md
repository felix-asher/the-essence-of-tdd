# The Essence of TDD

This repository documents an observation:

Sometimes tests pass, coverage improves, refactoring feels safe —
and yet, the design stops changing.

This is not a failure of testing tools.
It is often a failure to notice which assumptions became settled.

This document attempts to make that moment visible.

## Why this exists

Test-Driven Development is often described as a way to discover design.

In practice, teams reach a point where tests mainly confirm
what has already been decided, rather than revealing anything new.

When that happens, green tests preserve assumptions
instead of challenging them.

This repository explores:
- when that shift occurs
- why it is hard to notice
- how some teams detect it earlier

---

## What this is

This is not a framework or a methodology.

It is a collection of observations about:
- design discovery
- test scope and boundaries
- the moment assumptions become irreversible

---

## What this is NOT

This is NOT:
- a replacement for unit testing
- an argument against incremental development
- a prescription for how to practice TDD
- a claim that “most people are doing TDD wrong”

Discussion and counterexamples are welcome.

I may not actively respond.
The goal is to surface patterns, not to defend a position.
