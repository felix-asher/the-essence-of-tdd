# **The Essence of TDD**

**— Vertical-Slice First. Invariant-Driven. A Design Discovery Loop. —**

---

## Preface: Why This Document Exists

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is widely misunderstood.

“Write tests first.”
“A process for quality assurance.”
“Red → Green → Refactor.”

These statements aren’t wrong.

But they are insufficient.

---

The core of TDD is deeper.

**TDD is a practice for converging an uncertain, fragile reality into a design that actually holds.**

This document is not a prescription.
It is a lens for observing how design assumptions settle—or fail to.

---

This document is written for engineers who:

* Practice TDD but feel something is “off.”
* Write tests, yet find their design no longer advances.
* Maintain immaculate unit tests, only to see systems fail at integration.
* Use AI to generate tests, but sense that their confidence is shallow.

---

How to read this document:

1. **Chapters 1–7** describe TDD as a design discovery practice.
2. **Chapters 8–10** diagnose “TDD Cosplay,” where tests exist but learning stops.
3. **Chapter 11** walks through a concrete e-commerce example.
4. **Chapters 12–13** operationalize the Invariant Queue and discuss AI-era TDD.
5. **Chapters 14–16** define boundaries: growth stages, environments, and failure modes.

## 1. The Premise Shift

### The Common Misconception

```text
✗ Unit tests accumulate correctness.
✗ Integration tests merely verify connectivity.
✗ TDD is just the “Red → Green → Refactor” sequence.
```

This framing is incomplete.

Why?
**Because correct parts do not guarantee a correct system.**

---

### The Premise of This Document

```text
✓ What breaks is rarely implementation detail.
  It is assumptions, constraints, and meaning.

✓ What matters is not “does the feature run,”
  but “are invariants preserved end-to-end?”

✓ Therefore, TDD is not primarily a testing technique.
  It is a design discovery technique.
```

---

## 2. A Definition of Real TDD

**TDD is a design discovery loop that settles invariants, one vertical slice at a time.**

---

### Red

A declaration that the current world does not yet hold.

### Green

A signal that one specific assumption is now settled.
You no longer need to doubt it.

### Refactor

Observation time.
A deliberate pause to discover the next constraint likely to break.

---

## 3. Why Vertical Slice First

### The Limits of Horizontal Slicing

```text
✗ Measures only local correctness.
✗ Misses boundaries, state transitions, and timing.
✗ Creates false confidence about system invariants.
```

**Horizontal-slice TDD produces tested components, but rarely confirmed systems.**

---

### The Essence of a Vertical Slice

A vertical slice is the smallest cross-section that includes:

1. **Business Meaning** — a real outcome.
2. **Invariants / Kill Conditions** — what must never break.
3. **End-to-End Consistency** — a path crossing all relevant layers.

If it isn’t a vertical slice, you cannot answer:

> *“Does this world actually hold?”*

---

## 4. Integration Tests, Redefined

Integration tests are not “unit tests, but bigger.”

**They are the entry point for design discovery.**

* Written first
* Painfully red
* Maximally informative

They do not test connectivity.
They test whether meaning and constraints survive the journey.

---

## 5. Invariants and Constraints as a Priority Queue

### Not a List, but a Queue

Invariants and constraints are not tasks.
They are **unconfirmed design hypotheses**.

They must be managed as a **priority queue**, not a checklist.

---

### The Three Axes

```text
1. Lethality — If this breaks, does the system fail?
2. Irreversibility — How hard is this to change later?
3. Uncertainty — Do we need to learn this early?
```

---

### Operating the Queue

1. Confirm one invariant.
2. Observe how the system changed.
3. If new constraints appear, re-rank.

**The queue is never “done.”
Learning reshuffles it continuously.**

---

## 6. Where Unit Tests Actually Fit

Unit tests matter.

But they are not the protagonist.

Their role is to act as stabilizers — training wheels — that make vertical slices safe and fast.

The order is always:

```text
Integration → Unit
```

---

## 7. What This TDD Gives You

```text
✓ Early failure
✓ Explainable failure
✓ Decisions locked into executable form
✓ Abstractions driven by pressure, not taste
```

The result is not comfort.
**It is earned confidence.**

---

## 8. The Danger of “TDD Cosplay”

It is easy to imitate the form of TDD without practicing its substance.

We call this state **TDD Cosplay**.

```text
✓ Tests exist
✓ Rituals are followed
✓ CI is green
```

Yet design truth has not advanced.

---

## 9. Diagnostic Questions

If you cannot answer these, you may be cosplaying:

* What assumption became “no longer doubtful” when this test passed?
* Which invariant did this green actually settle?
* Why was this the next constraint to test?
* Does this test pierce a real vertical slice?

If the only answer is *“I feel safer,”* design has stalled.

---

## 10. The Definition of Failure

> **Tests increase, but settled assumptions do not.**

Conversely:

> **Few tests that settle a fatal invariant are success.**

---

## 11. Practice Example: E-Commerce Order Flow

Let's feel the difference with concrete code.
You can copy and paste these examples to verify the behavior yourself.

---

### Scenario

E-commerce flow:
1. Add item to cart.
2. Check stock.
3. Process payment.
4. Confirm order.

---

### Invariant List

```text
1. Stock >= Order Quantity
2. Order only confirmed after successful payment
3. Duplicate items increment quantity
4. Cancellation restores stock
5. Stock reservation happens before payment
6. Reservation expires in 15 mins
```

---

### Prioritization (3 Axes)

| Invariant | Fatal? | Irreversible? | Uncertain? | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Stock >= Order Qty | ◎ | ○ | ◎ | **1** |
| Payment Required for Order | ◎ | ◎ | ○ | **2** |
| Reserve before Payment | ◎ | ○ | ◎ | **3** |
| Reservation Expiry | ○ | △ | ◎ | 4 |
| Cancel restores stock | ○ | △ | ○ | 5 |

---

### The Anti-Pattern (Horizontal Slice)

First, the **wrong way**.
These unit tests all pass perfectly, yet the system contains a critical bug on integration.

#### 1. CartService.spec.ts (Unit)

```typescript
// src/cart/cart.service.spec.ts
import { CartService } from './cart.service';

describe('CartService', () => {
  it('should add item to cart', () => {
    const cart = new CartService();
    cart.addItem({ productId: 'P1', quantity: 2 });
    expect(cart.getItems()).toContainEqual(
      expect.objectContaining({ productId: 'P1', quantity: 2 })
    );
  });
});
```

#### 2. InventoryService.spec.ts (Unit)

```typescript
// src/inventory/inventory.service.spec.ts
import { InventoryService } from './inventory.service';

describe('InventoryService', () => {
  it('should return true if stock is sufficient', async () => {
    const mockDb = { getStock: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(10) };
    const inventory = new InventoryService(mockDb);
    
    const result = await inventory.checkStock('P1', 5);
    expect(result).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### 3. PaymentService.spec.ts (Unit)

```typescript
// src/payment/payment.service.spec.ts
import { PaymentService } from './payment.service';

describe('PaymentService', () => {
  it('should process payment successfully', async () => {
    const mockGateway = { charge: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('tx_123') };
    const payment = new PaymentService(mockGateway);
    
    const result = await payment.process(1000);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### The Reveal: Integration Failure

When combined, the following code allows **negative stock** under concurrency.

```typescript
// main.ts (The Reality)
// User A and User B click "Buy" simultaneously.

// Thread A
const stockA = await inventory.checkStock('P1', 1); // OK (Stock 1)

// Thread B (Interruption)
const stockB = await inventory.checkStock('P1', 1); // OK (Stock 1)

// Thread A
await payment.process(1000);
await order.confirm(); // Stock becomes 0

// Thread B
await payment.process(1000);
await order.confirm(); // 💥 Stock becomes -1 (Invariant Violated)
```

**The parts were correct. The system was broken.**

---

### The Correct Approach (Vertical Slice)

Now, the approach that **confirms invariants**.

#### Step 1: Vertical Slice Integration Test

We test the most fatal invariant "Stock >= Order Quantity" first, **including concurrency simulation**.

```typescript
// test/integration/order-process.spec.ts
import { TestDb } from '../utils/test-db';
import { CheckoutService } from '../../src/checkout/checkout.service';

describe('Order Process Integration (Vertical Slice)', () => {
  let db: TestDb;
  let checkout: CheckoutService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    db = new TestDb();
    checkout = new CheckoutService(db);
  });

  // Invariant: "Stock >= Order Quantity" must hold even under concurrency
  it('should prevent order completion if stock is depleted during process', async () => {
    // 1. Arrange: Only 1 item in stock
    await db.inventory.set('P1', 1);

    // 2. Act: Add to cart and start checkout (before reservation)
    const cart = new Cart();
    cart.addItem({ productId: 'P1', quantity: 1 });
    const session = await checkout.startCheckout(cart);

    // 3. Concurrency Simulation:
    // Someone else snatches the stock here
    await db.inventory.forceReduce('P1', 1); // Stock becomes 0

    // 4. Assert: Should fail on checkout completion
    // (A horizontal implementation would pass here and cause negative stock)
    await expect(
      checkout.completeCheckout(session)
    ).rejects.toThrow('Insufficient Stock');

    // 5. Invariant Assertion: Stock must never be negative
    const finalStock = await db.inventory.get('P1');
    expect(finalStock).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0);
  });
});
```

**🔴 RED: Breaks immediately (no implementation or no locking).**

---

#### Step 2: Minimal Implementation (Green)

Implement the bare minimum to protect the invariant.

```typescript
// src/checkout/checkout.service.ts
export class CheckoutService {
  constructor(private db: Database) {}

  async startCheckout(cart: Cart) {
    // Just create session or do nothing
    return { sessionId: 'sess_123', ...cart };
  }

  async completeCheckout(session: Session) {
    return this.db.transaction(async (tx) => {
      // 1. Lock and Check Stock (FOR UPDATE)
      const currentStock = await tx.inventory.getWithLock(session.productId);

      // 2. Guard: Invariant Check
      if (currentStock < session.quantity) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient Stock');
      }

      // 3. Reduce Stock
      await tx.inventory.reduce(session.productId, session.quantity);

      // 4. Charge and Confirm
      await this.paymentService.charge(session.amount);
      await tx.orders.create(session);
    });
  }
}
```

**✅ GREEN: Invariant Confirmed.**

The invariant "Stock >= Order Quantity" is no longer a guess. It is a **settled fact**.

---

#### Step 3: Refactor & Observe

Now that it's green, new constraints appear:

- What if payment fails? Do we rollback stock?
- Is the lock holding too long?

Add these to the **Priority Queue** and proceed to the next loop.

---

#### Step 4: Next Vertical Slice Test

Next, we test "Order confirmed only on Successful Payment."

```typescript
describe('Order Process Integration', () => {
  it('should not create order if payment fails', async () => {
    // Arrange
    await db.inventory.set('P1', 10);
    const cart = new Cart();
    cart.addItem({ productId: 'P1', quantity: 5 });
    
    // Force Payment Failure
    paymentGateway.setShouldFail(true);
    
    const checkoutService = new CheckoutService(db, paymentGateway);
    const session = await checkoutService.startCheckout(cart);
    
    // Act & Assert
    await expect(
      checkoutService.completeCheckout(session)
    ).rejects.toThrow('Payment failed');
    
    // Invariant: No Order Created
    const orders = await db.orders.findBySession(session.sessionId);
    expect(orders).toHaveLength(0);
    
    // Invariant: Stock Released
    const stock = await db.inventory.get('P1');
    expect(stock).toBe(10); // Rolled back
  });
});
```

**🔴 RED: Fails (Stock release not implemented).**

---

#### Step 5: Implementation

```typescript
class CheckoutService {
  async completeCheckout(session: CheckoutSession) {
    const reservation = await this.getReservation(session.reservationId);
    
    if (!reservation || reservation.expiresAt < Date.now()) {
      // Release Stock on Expiry
      await this.releaseReservation(reservation);
      throw new Error('Reservation expired');
    }
    
    try {
      // Charge Payment
      await this.paymentService.process(session.amount);
    } catch (error) {
      // Release Stock on Failure
      await this.releaseReservation(reservation);
      throw error;
    }
    
    // Confirm Reservation
    await this.confirmReservation(reservation);
    
    // Confirm Order
    return new Order(session);
  }
  
  private async releaseReservation(reservation: Reservation) {
    await this.db.transaction(async (tx) => {
      // Restore Stock
      await tx.inventory.increment(
        reservation.productId,
        reservation.quantity
      );
      await tx.reservations.delete(reservation.id);
    });
  }
}
```

**✅ GREEN: New Invariants Confirmed.**

---

## 12. Operating the Invariant Queue

* List invariants
* Rank by lethality, irreversibility, uncertainty
* Confirm one
* Re-rank

Never clear the queue.
Discovery never stops.

---

## 13. TDD in the Age of AI

AI accelerates TDD — and TDD Cosplay.

AI can generate code and tests.
**It cannot choose which assumptions matter.**

Invariant selection, prioritization, and observation remain human responsibilities.

---

## 14. The Four Stages of Sculpting

1. **Skeleton** — invariants and failure paths
2. **Translation** — UI/UX as a projection
3. **Reality Check** — exposure to real users
4. **Decision** — continue, pivot, or stop

Only Stage 1 makes the later stages safe.

---

## 15. The “Stacked Development” Trap by Environment

Enterprise, SI, and startup environments differ —
but the root failure is the same:

> **Believing the wrong premise too early.**

Vertical Slice TDD exists to surface that mistake early.

---

## 16. Where Vertical Slice TDD Fails

Vertical Slice TDD fails when:

* There is no uncertainty
* Speed is the only metric
* Certainty is politically rejected
* It is treated as process, not decision

A discovery tool is dangerous where discovery is forbidden.

---

## Afterword

TDD is not a technique for writing tests.

It is a discipline for working with the premises on which a system stands —
often before those premises are visible, named, or agreed upon.

Starting with a vertical slice is not about coverage or confidence.
It is about contact.
Contact with reality, and with the assumptions that break when touched.

A green test does not mean “this is correct.”
It means that one fatal assumption has been settled —
or quietly fixed in place.

That is the point where learning either continues, or stops.

This document does not offer a recipe, a framework,
or a new flavor of TDD.
If you are looking for a checklist, it will disappoint you.

It exists for a narrower purpose:
to help you notice the moment when learning has stalled —
and to suggest a way back into motion.

Some readers have asked how progress can be recognized in practice.

A non-normative note on this can be found in [appendix/SUCCESS METRICS](./appendix/SUCCESS_METRICS.md).
